You look like someone who could spare 15 seconds!

I am a front end developer currently trying to cement my full stack credentials. My stack is consistently **Angular** for the front and **RoR** for the back, using the corresponding [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/products.html) IDE's exclusively. How they manage to make consistently incredible products still blows me away. 

In a previous life I was a 3d character animator and hard-surface modeler, although at times I had to step into the domain of visual effects as well. During my time in those fields I was lucky enough to see some of what I had created in 3d [actually getting built in the real world](https://www.caesars.com/linq/high-roller). My primary tool of choice was [3D Studio Max](https://asean.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview).

From animator/modeler to developer, I have also taught these disciplines in a post secondary school setting. I taught introductory to advanced courses for years in my home city of Las Vegas, Nevada, and then later internationally in the far East.

Oh nuts. That was longer than 15 seconds. Apologies.

Since GitHub suggested including the following info, far be it from me to turn down an open invitation for self-promotion... 

_I’m currently working on ..._

_I’m currently learning_
NGRx, advanced Angular Routing and Security.

_I’m looking to collaborate on_
Full stack work, pro bono, for a charitable organization.

_Ask me about_
Where on the planet I happen to be at the moment.

_How to reach me_
Gmail. Although Pony Express may be more effective when i'm out in some of the more [remote and wonderful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havasu_Falls) parts of the world.
