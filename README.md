_`commence in 3...2...`_

You look like someone who could spare 15 seconds!

I am a full stack developer currently cementing my mobile dev credentials. My stack is typically **MEAN**, using the corresponding [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/products.html) IDE's exclusively. How they manage to make consistently incredible products still blows me away. 

In a previous life I was a 3d character animator and hard-surface modeler, although at times I had to step into the domain of visual effects as well. During my time in those fields I was lucky enough to see some of what I had created in 3d [actually getting built in the real world](https://www.caesars.com/linq/high-roller). My primary tool of choice was [3D Studio Max](https://asean.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview).

From animator/modeler to developer, I have also taught these disciplines in a post secondary school setting. I taught introductory to advanced courses for years in my home city of Las Vegas, Nevada, and then later internationally in the far East.

Oh nuts. That was longer than 15 seconds. Apologies.
